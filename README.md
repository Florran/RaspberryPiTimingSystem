# RaspberryPiTimingSystem

## Why?
A teacher at my school wanted a system to time stuff when riding horses. So I tried my best to make a simple system to replace the hand held stopwatch they used with something more automatic.

## Not Perfect
Yes, it is not perfect in multiple ways. There is no way any of the times are measured as perfectly as they should be, but as mentioned, it is for hobby riding.
